<Mr. Potatohead> This app features a game in which a user can make any part 
of the Mr. Potatohead appear or disappear by checking or unchecking some
checkboxes. Both portrait and landscape mode are supported. Note: The app
does reload after the screen orientation changes. This resets all images
to invisible, no matter the state of their corresponding checkbox.
